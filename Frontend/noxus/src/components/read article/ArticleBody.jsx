        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
          Noxus is an ai avatar generator that allows you create multiple images
          of yourself in different environments and settings. They mostly appear
          as pictures. Pictures are important ways we store and preserve
          memories. It is also a unique way we personalise our items. From
          stickers placed on phones and handheld devices to our identification
          in a virtual reality. An AI avatar is a digital character, powered by
          artificial intelligence, that lives in a virtual setting, like a game,
          social network, dating app or online world.

        <h1>What are Avatars?</h1>
        <p>
          Avatars are, in general, the virtual representation of a person or
          thing. They might range from simplistic animated graphics to
          cartoon-like characters. These kinds of virtual beings can also be a
          two-dimensional image that is typically used in social networks,
          forums, and online communities, or a three-dimensional image in an
          online game or virtual environment.
