### Kindly Go Throgh Evert Single Instruction on Here .

- Navigate to the avatarai Github Repository and Clone the Dev Branch
- Navigate into the Clone folde `cd avatarai.web`
- Futher navigate into the Frontend Folder `cd frontend`
- Now Run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies on you end.

## Important Note : after the above instsruction immedately created your own personal branch for everything you will be doing .

## I repeat Do not work on the Dev Branch , Neither should you edit anything on the Dev Branch

- use command `git cheeckout -b **branch name goes here ** ` to create your own branch.
- since we're using vite to start your application use `npm run dev` instead of `npm start` you application will be up and running .
- open your browser and input the url `localhost:5173` to see the output of your application.
- create the folder for your component in the components folder following the example present there.


## NOTE : The entirety of what you're doing should be in the components folder even in your cloned branch Do not tamper with the `App.jsx` file , to test the responsiveness of your component import it inot the `App.jsx`  notice the particular line you changed and revert back to original form when you're done ... we do not want to see the App.jsx in you PR 

## NOTE : Do not tamper with routes leave that to the team lead
